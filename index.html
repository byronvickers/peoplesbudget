See how the ACT Government spent money in 2017-18 across its 9 largest spending categories. Each circle represents the flow of money towards these programs.
<br/><br/>
This prototype focuses on tax monies flowing into the government and being distributed to different departmental/directorate portfolios, with potential, with more time, to model the data by policy theme, or to map the full flow of money from tax income, to agencies then out to various government services and contractors.
<br/><br/>
We believe that modeling the budget in this way, moving away from graphs (which many people struggle to read), and showing 'live' flows of funding that could eventually be modelled in near-real-time, would help provide a different way for Australians and Canberrans to think about, and consider, how government accumulates and spends money within the economy.
<br/><br/>
This form of visualisation can provide new insights into where large amounts of money - or small amounts - are accumulating, and help people consider whether they feel comfortable with the government's spending choices.</p>
